/*****************************************************************************
 * This is the JavaScript file that students need to modify to implement the 
 * password safe application.  The other file, client.js, must not be
 * modified.  That file handles page navigation, event handler binding, token 
 * setting/retrieving, preflighting, and provides some utility functions that 
 * this file should use for encoding/decoding strings and making server 
 * requests.
 *
 * Do not use any method other than serverRequest to make requests to the 
 * server!  It handles a few things including tokens that you must not
 * reimplement.
 *
 * Some of the functions in this file handle a form submission.  These 
 * are passed as arguments the input/output DOM elements of the form that was
 * submitted.  The "this" keyword for these functions is the form element 
 * itself.  The functions that handle form submissions are:
 *   - login
 *   - signup
 *   - save
 *
 * The other functions are each called for different reasons with different
 * parameters:
 *   - loadSite -- This function is called to populate the input or output 
 *                 elements of the add or load password form.   The function
 *                 takes the site to load (a string) and the form elements
 *                 as parameters.  It should populate the password form
 *                 element with the decrypted password.
 *   - logout -- This function is called when the logout link is clicked.
 *               It should clean up any data and inform the server to log
 *               out the user.
 *   - credentials -- This is a utility function meant to be used by the
 *                    login function.  It is not called from other client 
 *                    code (in client.js)!  The purpose of providing the
 *                    outline of this function is to help guide students
 *                    towards an implementation that is not too complicated
 *                    and to give ideas about how some steps can be 
 *                    accomplished.
 *
 * The utility functions in client.js are:
 *   - randomBytes -- Takes a number of bytes as an argument and returns
 *                    that number of bytes of crypto-safe random data
 *                    as a hexidecimal-encoded string.
 *   - hash -- Takes a string as input and hashes it using SHA-256.
 *             Returns a promise for the hashed value.
 *   - encrypt -- Takes a plaintext string, a key and an IV and encrypts
 *                the plaintext using AES-CBC with the key and IV.  The
 *                key must be a 32 byte hex-encoded string and the IV must
 *                be a 16 byte hex-encoded string.
 *                Returns a promise for the encrypted value, which is a 
 *                hex-encoded string.
 *   - decrypt -- Takes a ciphertext hex-encoded string, a key and an IV and
 *                decrypts the ciphertext using AES-CBC with the key and IV.
 *                The key must be a 32 byte hex-encoded string and the IV
 *                must be a 16 byte hex-encoded string.
 *                Returns a promise for the decrypted value, which is a 
 *                plaintext string.
 *   - serverRequest -- Takes the server resource and parameters as arguments
 *                      and returns a promise with two properties:
 *                        * response (a JavaScript response object)
 *                        * json (the decoded data from the server)
 *   - showContent -- Shows the specified page of the application.  This is 
 *                    how student code should redirect the site to other
 *                    pages after a user action.
 *   - status -- displays a status message at the top of the page.
 *   - serverStatus -- Takes the result of the serverRequest promise and
 *                     displays any status messages from it.  This just
 *                     avoids some code duplication.
 *
 * A few things you will need to know to succeed:
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Look at the MDN documentation for promises!
 *      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
 *
 * There are lots of resources online for how to use promises, so go learn
 * about them before starting on the project. It is crucial that students 
 * understand how promises work, since they are used throughout the boilerplate.
